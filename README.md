## Week 1

### **What is Machine Learning?**
1. Definition by Sir Arthur Samuel -
> Machine Learning is the field of study that gives the computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed for it.

2. Definition by Sir Tom Mitchel -
> A computer program is said to learn from *experience E* with some class of *tasks T* and *performance measure P*, if its performance at tasks **T**, as measured by **P**, improves with experience **E**.

Example of Playing Checkers:
-**E =** the experience of playing many games of checkers
-**T =** the task of playing checkers
-**P =** the probability of winning the game

### **What is Supervised Machine Learning?**
In supervised learning, we have both input and correct output corresponding to that input and all we need to do is to find a relation function (relationship) between the input and output.

*There are two types of Supervised Machine Learning -*
1. *Classification*
2. *Regression*

**Classification:** In such problems, we try to predict results in discrete values. We try to map input variables to discrete categories.
> Predicting whether the patient's tumor is malignant or benign giving his/her tumor information as input

**Regression:** In such problems, we try to predict results in continuous values. We try to map input variables to continuous functions.
> Predicting age of the person by giving his/her picture as input
